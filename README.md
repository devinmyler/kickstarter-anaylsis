# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

## Overview of Project
Analysing Kickstarter Campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals to visualize campaign outcomes to better understand the trends of successful campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges   

### Parent Category Outcomes

There is a lot of information in the dataset. First, it was important to isolate the specific variables which would pertain to the information we were going to be using. The data was filtered by Country, and Category, then visualized on success and failure.

### Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Next, the data was filtered further to only show the Theatre category, as that was the information we were looking for. 

Launch Date data visualizations suggest that spring and summer are the best times to launch a successful theatre-based kickstarter campaign. May, June and July are the most successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The next visualization was to see if the goals of the campaigns had anything to do with their success. The data was filtered by goal increments to create new categories for sorting and visualization. When charted, the highest differential of successful campaigns and failed campaigns can be easily recognized in goals under $14999 and in goals between $35000 and $44999, though the higher goal successes are based on very few outcomes, so could be considered outliers.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Recognizing the information you are trying to get out of each chart can come down to what data is applied to which axis of the chart. Also, remembering which filters you've applied is very important in reviewing data and analysing outcomes.

## Results

With the information we gathered based on the visualizations of the data, we can identify that a theatre campaign launched in May, June or July, with a goal of under $15000 has the highest chance of being successful based on historical precedent; but the lower the goal, the higher the rate of success, and May launches are the most successful.
